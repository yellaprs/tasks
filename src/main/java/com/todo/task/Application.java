/**
 * The boot application class that defines the spring boot application to have
 * the following properties<br>
 * <br>
 *
 * <ol>
 * <li>Act as a Eureka client; this behavior is provided by the
 * {@link EnableEurekaClient} annotation. The Eureka server URL is provided by
 * the external configuration provided by the config server.</li>
 * <li>The security is enabled to be covered by OAuth2 access token using the
 * {@link EnableOAuth2Resource} annotation. The URL from where the user would be
 * authenticated is provided by the
 * <code>spring.oauth2.resource.userInfoUri</code> property defined in the
 * external configuration.</li>
 * <li>{@link EnableEurekaClient} makes the app into both a Eureka "instance" (i.e. it
 * registers itself) and a "client" (i.e. it can query the registry to locate
 * other services).</li>
 * <li>{@link EnableCircuitBreaker} allows the application to respond to
+ * failures on services it relies. For example consider that you have an
+ * "employee" service that uses the "address" service to get addresses. Now if
+ * the address service goes down, then we can provide a fallback method using
+ * the circuit breaker. Now the address would be sent back using the static
+ * value from the method till the "address" service comes back again.</li>
 * <li>Note that all these annotations work in conjunction with properties
 * defined in the external configuration files specified by the config server.
 * </li>
 * </ol>
